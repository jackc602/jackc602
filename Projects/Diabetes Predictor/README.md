## Predicting Occurences of Diabetes based on Health Data

This project leverages skills such as machine learning, statistical testing, parameter tuning, and data wrangling in the realm of 
bioinformatics to predict type 2 diabetes outcomes of patients. This was a collaborative project and one of my first times applying
ML models such as Random Forests, K Means Clustering, and KNN Classification. In terms of deliverables for this project, our models 
did not function well enough to be feasibly deployed, however we did extract insight to how different features of health can be 
weighted in this use case, as well as some insights in health trends from our exploratory data analysis. One thing I found particulary 
interesting in this project came from evaluation of model performance according to income.

As can be seen in the plot above, our model performed worse as income increased. I found this incredibly interesting, 
as this was the first time I encountered a real problem of bias according to a group in my own work. I think this raises an interesting 
ethical question as to the deployement of a potentially effective model that may create or extremify existing biases in the real world.
Moving forward, I want to ensure that I am creating ethical work that promotes equailty.
