# Modelling MLB Team Success

## Overview 

This is an early project performed collaboratively aimed to predict what degree of playoff and regular season success 
a professional baseball team will have. The methods we used were to create a linear regression model to predict amount 
of regular season wins, and a KNN classifier to predict labels depicting post season success.
