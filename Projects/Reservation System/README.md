## Overview

This project is one outside of my normal scope, being written in C++ and outside the machine learning and 
analytics sphere. It is a reservation system, letting users view, create, and edit reservations of a space. 
While it is not the type of work I intend to do going forward, I think there's value in being well-balanced 
and exposed to different disciplines. Learning C++ was a challenge after programming exclusively in python 
so far, especially since my python experience was more functional than object oriented. I also found it a 
much greater challenge to collaborate on this work than on previous projects because of the collaboration
between classes. Overall I really enjoyed this as a learning experience, and I think some takeaways I got 
from it are small details are easier to get right the first time than to go back and fix, and with that 
your planning beforehand will make or break your efficiency in the long run.
