### Overview

This is the first ever end to end programming project I did. It is so interesting to look back at what it 
takes to do tasks which now seem basic without the use of commonplace libraries. Realistically this can be
redone in a quarter of the lines of code taking about a tenth of the runtime, but I still like to keep this 
work as a part of my portfolio. It reminds me of how far I have come already, and how far I have to go. 
Additionally this is an investigation that still interests me, as we found some interesting correlations 
between the walkability score of a city/area and its economic and environmental success. 

Included is our presentation, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jackc602/jackc602/blob/main/Projects/Walkability%20and%20City%20Success/walkability_presentation.pdf)
