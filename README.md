## About Me
- I am third year undergrad student studying Data Science with a minor in Mathematics at Northeastern University
- Last December I finished a 6 month co-op at General Atlantic, a private equity firm where I am helped to build out data driven reporting and process automation on the Fund Operations team. 
- I am from Maine, I love to be active skiing and running, and I am a huge Red Sox and Patriots fan!
- I'm passionate about applying the math and programming skills I've learned to build out efficient data driven infrastructure, build predictive models, and create analytics systems.
- Finance and sports particularly interest me, but more than anything I want to solve challenging problems using data. 

## Skills
I've used these technologies over the course of my professional experience, personal projects, and education.
